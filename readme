Instructions to run the code:

Training:
1. From directory cil-road-segmentation-final, run python3.5 rsrcnn/vgg16.py
2. The trained models, after every 3 epochs, are saved in rsrcnn/train_dir

Inference on our trained model:
1. Dowload the checkpoint file from https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/WZB9eOGZAoM0qDb
2. Put them in directory rsrcnn/train_dir/
3. From directory cil-road-segmentation-final, run python3.5 rsrcnn/vgg16.py submit
4. The predicted segmentation images of the satellite images in test set are saved in /rsrcnn/kaggle/test_set_output/
5. The csv submission file to be submitted on kaggle is saved in directory /cil-road-segmentation-final/
